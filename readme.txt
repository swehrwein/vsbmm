============
Dependencies
============
Please report any dependencies not listed here using github issues.

You'll need:
    Imagemagick
    Python
    Eigen3
    CMake
    OpenCV
    Theia


This relies on some external libraries you'll need to download:
    1. Dense Point Tracking:
       N. Sundaram, T. Brox, K. Keutzer
       Dense point trajectories by GPU-accelerated large displacement optical flow,
       European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)
       Crete, Greece, Springer, LNCS, Sept. 2010.

       Download the executable from
        https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/software.php
       and place it in the tracking/densetrack directory. Use the makefile
       to build the tracker there so you have an executable at
       tracking/densetrack/tracking.

    2. Theia - download and install from http://theia-sfm.org/

    3. maxflow-v3.01
       Y. Boykov and V. Kolmogorov
       An experimental comparison of min-cut/max- flow algorithms for
       energy minimization in vision
       IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
       vol. 26, no. 9, pp. 1124-1137, Sept. 2004.

       Download the maxflow-v3.01 package from
        http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/
       and place the code in the bvs folder, i.e. you should have
        bvs/maxflow-v3.01/maxflow.cpp, etc.

       Note: I use a custom instantiation of the Graph template from maxflow
       that isn't included in instances.inc (thanks to Yucheng Lu for pointing
       this out). To get the bvs code to build, you'll need to add the
       following line to maxflow-v3.01/instances.inc:
            template class Graph<float, float, double>;
       though you could probably also get away with changing the typedef near
       the top of BilateralSegment.cpp to Graph<float,float,float>

    4. Google Sparsehash
       https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash
       Install using their instructions. If it's installed somewhere other than 
       /usr/local/include/sparsehash, change bvs/CMakeLists.txt accordingly.

=====
Setup
=====
The scripts depend on having the following evironment variables set:
    ${DAVIS_ROOT} - root of a given set of davis images, s.t.
        ${DAVIS_ROOT}/JPEGImages/480p/bear/?????.jpg contains the bear inputs

    ${BGSEG} - path to this directory

There are two components to build using CMake:
    1. trackseg
    2. bvs

For each component, you may need to tweak the CMakeLists.txt file to correctly locate
OpenCV (on Mac I had to manually set OpenCV_Dir). Then,
    $ cd trackseg
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
    $ make
and likewise for bvs.

===================
Overview of scripts
===================

scripts/ contains scripts that run the method on DAVIS datasets:
    pipeline.sh - runs all steps, beginning with tracking. Note tracking only works on linux.
                  Each of the following is a step run by pipeline.
                  Example usage:
                    $ bash pipeline.sh bear my_results

                  where my_results is the desired output folder name for your results.
                  Segmentation results are placed in
                    $DAVIS_ROOT/Results/Segmentations/480p/my_results/bear

    brox2tt.sh - converts the Brox tracking dat file into a
                 .tt file to be read into a TrackTable.

    trackransac.sh - runs our method to classify tracks using background motion models
                     places results in $DAVIS_ROOT/Results/Dataterm/,

    bseg.sh - takes the track confidences from trackransac.sh and uses our variant of 
              bilateral video segmentation to produce a dense segmentation.

    segment.sh - once you've run tracking, you don't need to recompute tracks. this script
                 runs trackransac.sh and bseg.sh, using the already-computed tracking data.
